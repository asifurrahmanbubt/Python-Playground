## 📖 About This Repository  
This repo was originally created to document my Python learning journey. It contains various Python exercises, mini-projects, and code snippets I worked on while exploring Python.  

Since I’ve now committed to the **100 Days of Python Challenge**, this repository will no longer be updated.

## 🏆 What’s Next?  

🔄 **Transitioning to 100 Days of Python Challenge**  
- Instead of random practice, I’ll now focus on **structured daily coding** for 100 days straight!  
- The new repo will contain **daily folders** (`Day1/`, `Day2/`, etc.), each with Python scripts I write as part of my journey.
